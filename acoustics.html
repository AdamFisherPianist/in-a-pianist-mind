  <h2>What Makes a Piano Sound Like a Piano?</h2>
  <p>
    Every piano note you hear is more than just a single frequency. When a hammer strikes a string, it creates a fundamental pitch, but also a rich blend of additional frequencies called harmonics. These harmonics shape the tone, warmth, and character of the sound.
  </p>
  <p>
    Without harmonics, a piano would sound dull or synthetic. With them, each note becomes full and expressive. This harmonic mix is what separates a piano from a pure sine wave or digital beep.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Watch the String Vibrate</h2>
  <p>
    This animated waveform shows how a real piano string vibrates. The shape is created by mixing the fundamental note with several harmonics. Each bump and wave reflects the rich sound we hear from an actual piano.
  </p>

  <h2>Pure Tone vs Piano Note</h2>
  <p>
    A pure sine wave (top) is simple and smooth — it only contains one frequency. A real piano note (bottom), however, includes many harmonics that shape its sound. This is what makes music rich and expressive.

      <h2>What Are Harmonics?</h2>
      <p>
        When you play a piano note, you're not just hearing one sound. You're hearing a stack of frequencies called harmonics, or overtones. The first harmonic is the note you played — the "fundamental" — but every higher harmonic contributes to the timbre, or color, of the sound.

<section>
  <h2>Listen to A2</h2>
  <p>
    This is the sound of a real A2 note on the piano. Try to listen closely — you may be able to hear not only the main pitch, but the subtle ringing of higher harmonics.

      <h2>Spectrum Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        Using a spectrum analyzer, we can break the sound down into its components. Here's what the frequencies of a real A2 note look like.
