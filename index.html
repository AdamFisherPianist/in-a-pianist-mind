      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Adam — a student, pianist, and science enthusiast. I've been learning piano and solfège at the Conservatoire for years, while also exploring my love for physics and math. This site is where those two worlds meet.
      </p>
      <p>
        What started as a curiosity — “What really happens when I press a piano key?” — turned into a deep dive into harmonics, waveforms, and the physics of sound. Here, I explore the hidden structure behind a single note and how math and music intertwine.

      <h2>Why This Project</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve always loved both science and music, and I often felt like I had to choose between them. But the deeper I went into each, the more I saw how connected they are. When I sight-read a score, I see patterns the same way I do in math. When I strike a note, I hear a system of frequencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project represents how I think and learn — by blending disciplines and asking questions. It's part of my application to MIT, but also a personal journey into the invisible beauty behind music.
